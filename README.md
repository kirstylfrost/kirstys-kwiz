</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Errors & Validation</b></h4>
<p>
Issue with styling of feedback page navigation buttons needs to be resolved. Submit and reset buttons not included as part of the feedback form due to lack of understanding of JavaScript.
<br>
Site not completed â€“ I was confused by the structure of the syllabus. When I completed the comparative language section it went onto the P2 requirements. I automatically assumed I was required to build the project based on the principles of self-learning by searching online, comparing JavaScript to the languages I have learned so far. I was able to get much of it however I struggled when it came to inserting images and building forms.
<br>
As I have not met the requirements for this project, it will fail. When I come to re-submit, I will have learned JavaScript, enabling me to include the required elements.
<br>
When trying to access console when inspecting on browser received a message stating that it failed to load resource with an error of 404. Searched internet, found resoultion on  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22317206/failed-to-load-resource-the-server-responded-with-a-status-of-404-not-found target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>
<br>
No validation has taken place due to the project not being completed.
